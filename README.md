frontend-nanodegree-map
=======================
Project 5 of the Udacity Frontend Nanodegree
Dedicated to Lisa, who is more beautiful than her icon lets on, this app attempts to get your location
and shows the vegan/vegetarian venues in the area

It allows you to manually enter locations, and is designed to work well on any device


Can be viewed at http://kevdonk.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-map/

Instructions
================

Enter a location in the search bar at the bottom of the screen (or turn on location services for auto-detect)

Filter search results by typing a query in the search bar in the upper right hand corner

The list will contain any items that match contain query in the name, description, cuisine, or veg level (# or description)

Clicking on a marker or list item centers the map on the item and gives an info window with the address and website
